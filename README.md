### About me
Hi there, I'm Ann.

My career in Vienna started as a freelance web developer before joining a creative agency. During this time, I gained expertise in creating advertising materials such as websites, landing pages, newsletters, and animated banners. I also developed a keen interest in modern full-stack web development and have since upskilled in the PERN stack.
